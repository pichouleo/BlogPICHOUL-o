                I started to get interested in skateboarding through social media. That impressed me a lot. Afterwards, I tried to "renovate" an old board that I had as a child. Just learning to ride on was already a pleasure. Soon after, I bought my first "real" board, the one that really brought me into this world. Subsequently I made progress after progress, with a lot of falls, of course, but with monumental pleasure, whether in winter or in summer, hot or cold weather, nothing can prevent me from getting on my board every week, see every day.

                By entering this 100% skate lifestyle, a lot of things have changed in me, whether it is in terms of clothing or socially. Before, I would never have put on clothes that were loose or too big for me, but by dint of watching skate videos where skaters have this kind of style, I was more and more inspired by them and the Today I never see myself wearing skinny jeans again, it shows that skateboarding has opened my mind to a lot of things. Socially, it allowed me to meet new people, at the skate park people are very friendly, they like to help you progress no matter how big you are. This mentality is very positive, whether in the skate park or even in everyday life.

                Now I have a group of friends with me who are just as passionate as I am, every session I keep evolving, learning new tricks and having fun. In addition to that, I am going on Instagram, where my account is only related to skateboarding. I regularly post clips from my sessions. Anyway, to conclude, I can say that skateboarding has totally changed my life for the better, if you hesitate to do it for fear of mockery or shame, well do not hesitate because you will find plenty of people to encourage you and make you progress. Have a nice skate !!
